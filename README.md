# Strong Password Generator Project

*Group Project by Kai Wolff, Munira Mohamed and Afshana Begum*

## Introduction

A strong password is one of the main elements in cybersecurity.

As a cybersecurity expert, you've been asked to develop a python application to check the strength of a password and to recommend a strong password in case the entered password doesn't meet the password's policy.

## Aims and Objectives:

App Specifications:
- The app can be a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- The app should provide a list of actions so the user can choose the wanted action by entering the a number or a letter (for example, 1) Password Strength Checker, 2) Strong Password Generator, 3) Exit, etc).
- The app should show the action list after executing and finishing each action (loop).


Project Tasks:
1- Password Strength Checker:
  - Password's Policy: Write a password's policy (For example, number of characters, special characters, etc), this policy should be used to validate the entered passwords.
  - Most Common Password List: compile an updated list of the most common passwords and check the entered password against this list to protect against dictionary attacks.
  - Reading the Password: Read a password from the user.
  - General Password Strength Check: Check it against the password policy and the most common password list.
  - User-Based Password Strength Check: Read the user first name, last name and birthdate and check the existence of these information in the password.
  - Generate a report for each password (on the screen and can be exported to a text file), the report should provide the following information in a human-friendly language:
    - The final result whether the password is strong or weak.
    - The detailed reason(s) of this final result.
  - The user can export the report to a text file.

2-   Strong Password Generator - the requirements are as follows:
  - Generate a password
    - A new function was defined and named as 'generate_password' which passes the arguments user_firstname, user_lastname and user_birthyear as these will be required to be passed in the function. 
    - In order to generate a password, it was necessary to extract some values such as the max_length (number of characters in the password) and allowed_charaters ( these are the special characters) from the password_policy function.
      
    - A new variable was defined as password with an empty string so that when the password is generated by the system, it will add to this string 
      
    - random and string modules were imported in order to use them as part of the password generator.
      
    - The password was generated using a for loop (iterates over the if else statements) with if, else statements, the range() function (returns a sequence of characters starting from 0 to maximum_length ) and defined a variable called random_character with the random module randint() method (randomly returns a character of its choice according to the if else statament)
      
    - string.ascii_lowercase and string.ascii_uppercase: 
  - Check it against the password's policy, and the most common password list.
  - Check the existence of user's information (first name, last name, birthdate, etc) in the password.
  - Show the generated password and ask the user whether to generate another password using same user's information  

```python
    def generate_password(self, user_firstname, user_lastname, user_birthyear):

        while True:

            # reading through the password policy and looping through to extract necessary values to check and generates the password
            policy_checklist = self.read_password_policy()
            max_length = policy_checklist[5]
            allowed_characters = list(policy_checklist[6])

            # Generating the password using random
            password = ""
            for character in range(max_length):

                random_num = random.randint(1,4)

                if random_num == 1:
                    password += random.choice(allowed_characters)
                elif random_num == 2:
                    password += random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase)
                elif random_num == 3:
                    password += random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase)
                else:
                    password += random.choice(string.digits)

            # Checking against the user's details, password's policy and the most common password list.
            user_details_check = self.check_user_details(password, user_firstname, user_lastname, user_birthyear)
            policy_compliance_check = self.check_policy(password)
            checking_list = self.check_list(password)
            if user_details_check == False or policy_compliance_check == False or checking_list == False:
                # print("Regenerating a new password: ") # this is a test to check against user details
                continue

            print(password)

            # Shows the generated password and ask the user whether to generate another password using same user's information -
            # not save the password but maybe send a report for why it is strong

            while True:
                ask_again = input("Would you like to generate a new password? (y/n) ")
                if ask_again == "y":
                    break
                elif ask_again == "n":
                    break
                else:
                    print("Please input a valid option.")

            if ask_again == "n":
                break
```
